This Jupyter Notebook showcases how a RNN network can learn English vocabs ("one", "two", etc) and transform them into digits and do basic addition and multiplication.
Consider the following regression problem. There is a sequence of words representing positive integers, e.g.["three", "one", "four", "one", "five", "two", "five", "three", "five"] and we want to know the product of the associated numbers. The result for the above example should be 9000.
